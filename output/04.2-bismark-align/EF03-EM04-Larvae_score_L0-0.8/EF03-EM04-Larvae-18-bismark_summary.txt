Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.5.4])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/srlab/programs/samtools-1.20/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is ../../data/genome/	(absolute path is '/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/data/genome/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)
Processing sequences up to read no. 10000 from the input file
Attention: early reports suggested that high values of -p  to have diminishing returns. Please test different values using a small subset of data for your hardware setting.
Each Bowtie 2 instance is going to be run with 8 threads. Please monitor performance closely and tune down if necessary!

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/output/04.2-bismark-align'):
../../data/EF03-EM04-Larvae_R1_001.fastp-trim.20220827.fq.gz
../../data/EF03-EM04-Larvae_R2_001.fastp-trim.20220827.fq.gz
Library was specified to be not strand-specific (non-directional), therefore alignments to all four possible bisulfite strands (OT, CTOT, OB and CTOB) will be reported
Output will be written into the directory: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/output/04.2-bismark-align/EF03-EM04-Larvae_score_L0-0.8/
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Summary of all aligner options:	-q --score-min L,0,-0.8 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Current working directory is: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/output/04.2-bismark-align

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/data/genome/

Single-core mode: setting pid to 1
