Bismark report for: ../../data/EF05-EM01-Larvae_R1_001.fastp-trim.20220827.fq.gz and ../../data/EF05-EM01-Larvae_R2_001.fastp-trim.20220827.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/ceasmallr/data/genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.0 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	4075
Mapping efficiency:	40.8% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	4472
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1453
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	997	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	1054	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	1043	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	981	((converted) bottom strand)
