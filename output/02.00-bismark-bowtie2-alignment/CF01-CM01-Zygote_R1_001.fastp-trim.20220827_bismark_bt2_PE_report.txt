Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sam/gitrepos/ceasmallr/data/Cvirginica_v300/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	32085370
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	4232230
Mapping efficiency:	13.2% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	26181125
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1672015
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	5
