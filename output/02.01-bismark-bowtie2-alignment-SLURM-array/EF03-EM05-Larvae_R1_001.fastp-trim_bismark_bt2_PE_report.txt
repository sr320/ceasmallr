Bismark report for: /gscratch/scrubbed/samwhite/gitrepos/ceasmallr/output/00.00-trimming-fastp/EF03-EM05-Larvae_R1_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz and /gscratch/scrubbed/samwhite/gitrepos/ceasmallr/output/00.00-trimming-fastp/EF03-EM05-Larvae_R2_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/scrubbed/samwhite/gitrepos/ceasmallr/data/Cvirginica_v300/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 15 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	136490831
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	38974361
Mapping efficiency:	28.6% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	83976855
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	13539615
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	23

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	9672122	((converted) top strand)
